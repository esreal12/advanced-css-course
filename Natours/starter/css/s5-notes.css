Section 5.33 Review: Basic Principles of Responsive Design and Layout Types

    1. Fluid Grids and Layouts:
        To allow content to easily adapt to the current viewport width used to browse the website.
        Uses % rather than px for all layout-related lengths.

    2. Flexible/Responsive Images:
        Images behave differently than text content, and so we need to ensure that they also adapt
        nicely to the current viewport.

    3. Media Queries:
        To change styles on certain viewport widths (breakpoints), allowing us to create different 
        version of our website for different widths.

    Layout Types:
        - Float Layouts
        - Flexbox
        - CSS Grid
